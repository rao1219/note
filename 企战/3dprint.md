[知乎](http://www.zhihu.com/question/19795862)

+ 航空航天领域，歼-20肯定是小批量生产，不会一下子做几百架，卫星也不会一下子发射一堆上去，这些领域，3D  打印大有可为，且航空航天部门都巨有钱，对价格迟钝到任性，不用3D 打印技术简直没天理。其实，北航的王华明教授已作出不错的成绩，他用激光3D打印，成形的飞机承力结构件居然达到4m的尺寸，另美国人也刮目相看。
+ 生物医疗领域，牙齿、骨骼的3D打印已相当成熟，而随着生命科学的进步，3D打印器官也许真的能变为现实。
+ 文化创意领域，把好的创意打印出来，这是目前3D打印最为火热的版块。3D照相馆，手办模型，艺术品打印，沙盘模型，任性的土豪可以试着往这里边砸些钱，万一3D梦想实现了呢！
+ 工业设计领域，快速原型，缩短产品研发周期，这才是3D打印的初心，研究性能更好的快速原型材料，不断改进快速原型工艺，获得质量更好，成本更低的模具原型，这是制造业4.0时代依然不会过时的话题。

### 将来
Whether or not they arrive en-mass in the home, 3D printers have many promising areas of potential future application. They may, for example, be used to output spare parts for all manner of products, and which could not possibly be stocked as part of the inventory of even the best physical store. Hence, rather than throwing away a broken item (something unlikely to be justified a decade or two hence due to resource depletion and enforced recycling), faulty goods will be able to be taken to a local facility that will call up the appropriate spare parts online and simply print them out. NASA has already tested a 3D printer on the International Space Station, and recently announced its requirement for a high resolution 3D printer to produce spacecraft parts during deep space missions. The US Army has also experimented with a truck-mounted 3D printer capable of outputting spare tank and other vehicle components in the battlefield.

As noted above, 3D printers may also be used to make future buildings. To this end, a team at Loughborough University is working on a 3D concrete printing project that could allow large building components to be 3D printed on-site to any design, and with improved thermal properties.

Another possible future application is in the use of 3D printers to create replacement organs for the human body. This is known as bioprinting, and is an area of rapid development. You can learn more on the bioprinting page, or see more in my bioprinting video or the Future Visions gallery.
